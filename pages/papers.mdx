# Interesting papers I have come across.

I've found some pretty interesting papers that have made me think deeply (or laugh). I figure this would be a good place to share them.


- [**Male Refrigerator Blindness**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1316179/): As it turns out, there's a scientific basis to why I can never find the jam in the fridge when it's right in front on me. The funniest part is that the condition supposedly becomes less severe with time, but "human males who remain single exhibit an adaptive resilience to refrigerator blindness."
- [**The FLAN Language Model**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.01652.pdf): To my understanding, OpenAI's differentiating factor is that it believes that models can reach AGI by simply training them on larger and better datasets. However, this paper shows that a model (FLAN, or Fine Tuned Language Net) trained by Google on 137B parameters (compared to GPT-3's 175B), on supposedly [less clean data](https://venturebeat.com/2021/09/07/large-language-models-arent-always-more-complex/) outperfomed GPT-3. What I find very interesting is the possibility that AGI may not be acheived necessarily by the group with the most computing power. It's still a factor, but not necessarily an unbeatable, dominant one. 
- [**Twitter's Scaling Strategies in 2013**](http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-architecture-twitter-uses-to-deal-with-150m-active-users.html): [High Scalability](http://highscalability.com) is one of the most interesting sites I've had the pleasure of coming across this year. This article is especially interesting, highlighting the complexities involved in scaling a site like Twitter very well. I've always wondered what engineers at large tech co's do all day, and shines some light on it.
