# Shakeel's Thoughts

<p>I thank you for taking the time to visit a selected collection of my thoughts. And I mean that sincerely, because each view is another point for a vain metric of viewcount I love to track. This blog is as austere in design as possible, and that is on purpose. If you care to know why, read [this](/philosophy). The TLDR is that a blog is about content, not design, and so if the purpose is to create the best blog possible, one would not focus at all on design (although this holds less true if the goal is maximum clicks).</p>
<p>Blog posts generally fall under one of five categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>[Philosophy](/tags/Philosophy)</li>
  <li>[Finance](/tags/Finance)</li>
  <li>[Book Reviews](/tags/Book%20Review)</li>
  <li>[Tech](/tags/Tech)</li>
  <li>[Global Events](/tags/Global%20Events)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may be wondering, what makes me qualified to comment on these topics. The answer is absolutely nothing. I would hope that you still find it interesting regardless.</p>
<p>One final note: in my opinion, the mark of a great writer is one that can complex topics in a way that both provides the meaty, cut and dry core knowledge while keeping the reader engaged. My aim here, in part, is to do that. If I'm failing at this goal, <a href = "mailto:shakeel@atlasfinance.org">let me know</a></p>
