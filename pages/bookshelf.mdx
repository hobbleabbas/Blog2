# Books I have yet to read

<p>The following is a series of books that I'd like to read, as well as a reasoning for why I want to go over it. Any new suggestions are welcome too.</p>



- **Clean Code (Martin)**: An interesting statistic I came across on Twitter was that we <br /> spend 10X more time reading code then writing. I'm hoping that this <br /> book will allow me to read code faster.
- **The Splendid And The Vile (Larkson)**: I realized I know surprisingly little about world war 2, and more broad world history past the Roman empire in general. I've heard lots of praise for this book and figured it would be an excellent place to start.

[**Latest Post:**](/posts/foundation) Why Foundation (Asimov) Is So Captivating.
