## Books that I have yet to read
<p>The following is a series of books that I'd like to read, as well as a reasoning for why I want to go over it. Any new suggestions are welcome too.</p>


- **Clean Code (Martin)**: An interesting statistic I came across on Twitter was that we <br /> spend 10X more time reading code then writing. I'm hoping that this <br /> book will allow me to read code faster.
- **The Splendid And The Vile (Larkson)**: I realized I know surprisingly little about world war 2, and more broad world history past the Roman empire in general. I've heard lots of praise for this book and figured it would be an excellent place to start.
- **The Feynman Lectures On Physics**: I read [Six Easy Pieces](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/six-easy-pieces-essentials-of/9780465025275-item.html?ikwid=six+easy+pieces) on a whim a few months ago. I was eager from the forward, after seeing the claim that Feynman had a special way of breaking down complex concepts. I wasn't disappointed. I would love to dig into the unabridged version.
- **A Game Of Thrones**: I was around 12 when I found out about the political intrigue that exists in ASOIF, but wasn't allowed to read it (for obvious reasons). Although I know the full plot at this point, I still want to read the books (which, as the saying goes, always better the show). Plus, there's always the chance that [the books will end differently than the show.](https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-author-george-rr-martin-promises-different-ending-for-books-2979235)
- **Capital (Piketty)**: This caught my eye more due to the hype around it than an initial interest in macroeconomics. I am curious to read what Piketty described as his magnum opus, especially given how broadly it has apparently impacted the field and politics.
- **Anti-Piketty (Martin)**: A compilation of counterarguments to Capital's central theses. This will provide a much better picture of the enviroment, I believe.
- **The Entrepreneur's Guide To A Biotech Startup (Kolchinsky)**: This is largely inspired by Atlas, which is starting with only biotech tickers. I can't build a platform around investing in a sector I don't understand myself. That aside, biotech is an interesting sector not only for its volatility, but also for how distinct it is from most other industries. It's driven largely by reducible chance, in that it's success (especially in early stages) depends on the outcome of a hypothesis, which could theoretically be answered faster with more surrounding data about the human body. It is for this reason I'm much more bullish on biotech as a sector in the future as more and more data is availiable and more tools are built to process them (e.g. Will Manidis' [science.io](https://science.io))
- **Atlas Shrugged (Rand)**: Apparently a major book on the good of capitalism. In today's enviroment where there is very little discourse that I can see about the positives of capitalism, I think this could be an important source of balance. Plus, there's an active effort to suppress and condemn it. That tells me there's probably something of value to be found in it.
- **Founders At Work (Livingston)**: By YC cofounder Jessica Livingston, this provides an insight into the early days at startups. I'm extremely curious of the actions of people who have actually built rocket ship companies, and who better to tell it than someone who was involved in incubating them.
- **Enders Game**: Can't believe I haven't yet read this. 
- **Growth (Smil)**: Growth, particulary fast growth, seems to be a consistent presence of the lives of the most successful. If I can learn even a little bit more about the mechanics and situation around, this is a good investment for me.
- **The Singularity Is Near**: A phenomenally important book I want to read without reading anything else concurrently. It's rare to have a book that is consistently accurate in its prediction in the trajectories of the future.
- **The Selfish Gene**
- **Measure What Matters**
- **Skin In The Game**
- **The Origin Of Species**
- **The Wealth Of Nations**
- **The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich**
- **The Eye Of The World**
- **Meditations**
- **The Blockchain revolution**
- **Guns, Germs, And Steel**
- **Never Split The Difference**
- **The God Delusion**
- **DaVinci (Isaacson)**
- **Antifragile**
- **All The Shah's Men**
- **Loonshots**
- **Learn like a polymath**
- **Loonshots**
- **Cryptonomicon**
