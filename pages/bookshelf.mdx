# Books I have yet to read

<p>The following is a series of books that I'd like to read, as well as a reasoning for why I want to go over it. Any new suggestions are welcome too.</p>


- **Clean Code (Martin)**: An interesting statistic I came across on Twitter was that we <br /> spend 10X more time reading code then writing. I'm hoping that this <br /> book will allow me to read code faster.
- **The Splendid And The Vile (Larkson)**: I realized I know surprisingly little about world war 2, and more broad world history past the Roman empire in general. I've heard lots of praise for this book and figured it would be an excellent place to start.
- **The Feynman Lectures On Physics**: I read [Six Easy Pieces](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/six-easy-pieces-essentials-of/9780465025275-item.html?ikwid=six+easy+pieces) on a whim a few months ago. I was eager from the forward, after seeing the claim that Feynman had a special way of breaking down complex concepts. I wasn't disappointed. I would love to dig into the unabridged version.
- **A Game Of Thrones**: I was around 12 when I found out about the political intrigue that exists in ASOIF, but wasn't allowed to read it (for obvious reasons). Although I know the full plot at this point, I still want to read the books (which, as the saying goes, always better the show). Plus, there's always the chance that [the books will end differently than the show.](https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-author-george-rr-martin-promises-different-ending-for-books-2979235)
