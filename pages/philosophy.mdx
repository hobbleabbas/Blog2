# Blog Philosophy, or essentializing to value

Blog. The word itself is synonymous to web2. As with any popular phenomenon, it’s become wrapped with adornment – fancy fonts, nicer designs, platforms built around creating nicer looking blogs. A lot of this stems from a desire for attention – a nicer site brings more clicks, (in theory) keeps people on for longer, ranks higher on search engines, etc.

When deciding to write this blog, I also decided to try and make it the best blog possible. In order to do so, there has to be an understanding of what makes a good blog. This post documents my ideas as to what a blog actually is, and then how to create the best blog ever.

What is a blog?
At its core, a blog is a long form medium of expression. It allows individuals to express their opinions and ideas in a both a deep and organization unaffiliated manner.

A good way to look deeper into this, I believe, is to look at what a blog is not. A blog isn’t a short soundbite, or a formal expression. It isn’t necessarily any one structure – essays or reflections or reviews, but rather just any long form personal expression. 

For the most part, the emotional goal underlying a blog is generally self satisfaction
