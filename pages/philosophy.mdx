# Blog Philosophy, or essentializing to value

Blog. The word itself is synonymous to web2. As with any popular phenomenon, it’s become wrapped with adornment – fancy fonts, nicer designs, platforms built around creating nicer looking blogs. A lot of this stems from a desire for attention – a nicer site brings more clicks, (in theory) keeps people on for longer, ranks higher on search engines, etc.

When deciding to write this blog, I also decided to try and make it the best blog possible. In order to do so, there has to be an understanding of what makes a good blog. This post documents my ideas as to what a blog actually is, and then how to create the best blog ever.

## What is a blog?

What is a blog? At its core, a blog is a long form medium of expression. It allows individuals to express their opinions and ideas in a both a deep and organization unaffiliated manner.

A good way to look deeper into this, I believe, is to look at what a blog is not. A blog isn’t a short soundbite, or a formal expression. It isn’t necessarily any one structure – essays or reflections or reviews, but rather just any long form personal expression.

In an ideal world, a blog's solely personal affiliation would allow people to express their views without worrying about how it looks. Unfortunately this isn't the case, with worry about being judged by both people (organizations only disassociate with people over views because they're worried about being judged or have people internally that judge them).

With that in mind, I intentionally try not to suppress my thoughts in this blog, on principle.

## The aim of a blog

I'll save you the false modesty. A blog's primary purpose, for most people, is the attention and subsequent happiness that you can receive with a large amount of people consuming your content. This is made more potent when the attention comes from people you know personally.

It's the same principle that guides most social platforms, be it Instagram, YouTube, or Twitter. This often leads to people wearing a mask to create something that others may find interesting. 

I would be lying if this wasn't partially the aim of this blog, too. However, I'm also writing this is a reflection for myself in the future, to gauge how I've improved on less quantifiable factors.

As such, although it'll probably yield fewer reads, my goal for this blog is high quality, in depth reflections and content. The content should convey the information in the most thorough and best way possible, and keep readers actively engaged without sacrificing on prose[^1]. 

## Focus on content over aesthetics

I love UI, and making sites look good (I've come to the realization that this is probably a waste of time, and actually plan to write a post about this). However, if someone comes to my blog, it should be solely for the content, with no emphasis whatsoever on UI.

The UX on the blog isn't terrible, although a good indicator of how good the content is would be to intentionally create a shitty UX and see if it has a very large impact on UX.

### Inspiration from Paul Graham and Patrick Collison

The original principle of content over aesthetics comes from what I noticed about my own reading habits. Although I am more likely to click immediately to a post nice UI, the ones I come back to most consistently (Paul and Patrick's) have some of the worst designs.

If I recall an old post about the thought process behind creating Hacker News correctly, this is intentional by Graham as well.

## Wordy Content

The content on my blog is wordy on purpose. While it violates the principle of conveying content in the simplest way possible, it provides a good indicator of the quality of what I'm writing about. 

My assumption here is that even if the content is a tough read, if it is really truly insightful, a large portion of readers will continue scrolling through.

[^1]: This definition will almost certainly change over time. You can see a log of all the times I've changed the goal on [GitHub](https://github.com/hobbleabbas/blog). There is a blog philosophy changelog in the main readme file.
