# Some Projects I've Worked On

I really love working on cool projects. The following are some that I've created in my spare time.

- **Office Communication Software**: Work in progress. Allows medical staff to communicate sensetive information to the front desk easily, for example billing discounts given to the patient. 
- [**Kinship Canada**](https://kinshipcanada.com): Custom built charitable site, including a tax receipt generation system. Primarily written in PHP and JS, with a MySQL backend.
- [**Atlas**](https://www.atlasfinance.co): Receive stock news the moment it comes out. The system detects major news, formats it, and delivers it to users. Allows you to invest in major events before the market reacts. Written in Python, Rust, Node.js, NextJS, React Native, with Postgres, GraphQL, sadand MySQL backend.
- WaliBook: Anonymized social network for Wali grads
- [**Dent247**](https://dent247.com): A search engine for dentists. Undergoing revamp.
